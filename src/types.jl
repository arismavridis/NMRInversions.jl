    brd
Solver for tikhonov (L2) regularization, following [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1109/78.995059)

Very fast, but only uses the identity as tiknohonov matrix.
No options required, it just works.

Primal dual hybrid gradient method for L1 regularization,

from Reci et al. / Journal of Magnetic Resonance 281 (2017) 188–198
It can be used as a "solver" for the invert function.

The particular choice of σ and τ is heuristic. 
A smaller σ will increase the stability while reducing the convergence speed
of the algorithm. A good compromise between the two was found when σ = 0.1 and τ = 10. 
The best values of σ and τ will depend slightly on the scaling of the signal. 
Therefore, it is best to normalize the NMR signal to a maximum of 1,
a technique which was followed in the cited study.
